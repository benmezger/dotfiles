# Dotfiles

## Requirements

1. Ansible

How to run:

1. ```$ git submodule update --init --recursive```
2. ```$ cd playbooks```
2. ```$ ansible-playbook -i inventory linux.yml -K```

My Linux dotfiles can be found in the ```master``` branch.

Note: A few files are encrypted. You will need to adapt them for your needs.
