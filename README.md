I currently have one main dotfile repository (private), since it's getting too big
I decided to separate OSX and Linux's dotfiles. This branch is specific for OSX.
The reason I am doing this is because I started having Linux specific files on my OSX and OSX specific files on
my Linux box, and that kinda sucked.

Note: A few files are encrypted. You will need to adapt them for your needs.

My Debian dotfiles can be found in the ```master``` branch.

Run ```bootstrap/install.sh``` to start the bootstrap
