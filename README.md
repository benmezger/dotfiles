I currently have one main dotfile repository (private), since it's getting too big
I decided to separete OSX and Linux's dotfiles. This branch is specific for Debian/Archlinux currently running on X220.

Note: A few files are encrypted. You will need to adapt them for your needs.

My OSX dotfiles can be found in the `osx` branch. and my Linux Macbook Pro version can be found at `master`

Run ```bootstrap/install.sh``` to start the bootstrap
